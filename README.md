# SQL Server Management 

## Overview

This repository contains code for SQL Server and PL/SQL, designed to showcase various database management tasks, queries, and projects using SQL Server, Transact-SQL, and PL/SQL. It serves as a resource for those looking to learn and practice database management and SQL query writing.

## Key Concepts

1. **SQL Server Basics**:
   - SELECT queries and filtering data using WHERE and HAVING clauses.
   - Data aggregation techniques using GROUP BY and COUNT.
   
2. **Joins**:
   - Understanding and using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN to combine data from multiple tables.

3. **Subqueries**:
   - Writing and optimizing subqueries for data analysis.

4. **Stored Procedures**:
   - Creating reusable SQL code with stored procedures for automated tasks.

5. **Triggers**:
   - Writing triggers for automatic actions triggered by data changes.

6. **PL/SQL Functions**:
   - Writing PL/SQL functions to execute complex logic directly in the database.

7. **Transactions**:
   - SQL Server and PL/SQL support the concept of transactions, which allow for reliable and consistent changes to the database. This ensures data integrity by grouping multiple operations into a single unit.
   - **Commit**: The `COMMIT` statement is used to save all the changes made during the current transaction. Once committed, changes are permanent.
   - **Rollback**: The `ROLLBACK` statement is used to undo any changes made during the current transaction if something goes wrong, maintaining database consistency.

## Financial Advisor Database Management Project

This project involves building a **Financial Advisor Database** designed to store, manage, and analyze financial information for clients.
The database serves as a centralized repository for financial data, where transactions, investments, and client details are organized and processed.

### Project Features

1. **Client Information Management**:
   - Store client personal details such as name, age, income, and risk tolerance.
   - Enable the financial advisor to assess the client's risk profile and make tailored recommendations.

2. **Investment Portfolio Management**:
   - Track various investments made by clients, including investment types, amounts, and duration.
   - This helps the advisor track portfolio performance and suggest adjustments when necessary.

3. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Evaluate risk based on the client's investment portfolio and individual risk tolerance.

4. **Financial Advice Generation**:
   - Generate personalized financial advice for clients based on their risk profiles and investment history.
   - PL/SQL procedures help automate the creation of these reports, providing actionable insights for clients.

### Transaction Management in the Project

In this project, transaction management is crucial for maintaining data integrity when making changes to the financial data. Operations such as inserting new client records, updating investment information, or generating risk reports must be treated as transactions to ensure that all changes are applied successfully or rolled back in case of errors.

- **Commit**: Once all changes to client records and investment data are successfully completed, the transaction can be committed to the database, making all changes permanent.
- **Rollback**: In case of any errors during the transaction, a rollback ensures that all changes are undone, maintaining the consistency of the data.
